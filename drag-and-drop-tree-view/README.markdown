# Drag and Drop Tree View

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/esironal/pen/jHJlK](https://codepen.io/esironal/pen/jHJlK).

Uses jQuery UI to create a tree-view structure whose nodes can be dragged and dropped. Does basic validation to ensure a parent node is not dropped on a child node. Removes empty UL elements.

Forked from [Josh Einstein](http://codepen.io/josheinstein)'s Pen [Drag and Drop Tree View](http://codepen.io/josheinstein/pen/oKzgw/).
